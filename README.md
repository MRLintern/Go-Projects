# Go-Projects
A selection of Go Projects that I have Developed Allowing me to Understand this Wonderful Language

Each project is sorted into its own repository so look at the `README.md` files for an explanation of each project.

## General Requirements for all Programs

1. `Ubuntu` OS.
2. Go; if you don't have it, get it from [here](https://go.dev/doc/install)

## Running/building the Application

Two methods:
        
        $ mkdir test && cd test
        $ go mod init test
        $ go run .
        
         or, by building go binaries
         
        $ go build
        test main.go go.mod
        $ ./test
        
        
 ## Further Resources for Building Go Applications
 
 This [link](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-and-install-go-programs) provides good examples
 of building and running go applications within the Linux environment.
