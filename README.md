# Go-Projects
A selection of Go Projects that I have Developed Allowing me to Understand this Wonderful Language

Each project is sorted into its own repository so look at the `README.md` files for an explanation of each project.

## General Requirements for all Programs

1. `Ubuntu` OS.
2. Go; if you don't have it, get it from [here](https://go.dev/doc/install)

## Running/building the Application

Two methods:

        $ go run .
        
         or
         
        $ go build
